Here are some *basic and important terms in Wireshark* you should know while analyzing network traffic:

---

✅ *Key Wireshark Terms:*

1. *Packet* – A single unit of data captured from the network.

2. *Frame* – The complete data link layer packet, including headers.

3. *Protocol* – The rules for communication (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, ARP).

4. *Source & Destination* – IP addresses or MACs showing who sent and who received the packet.

5. *Port* – Logical endpoints (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

6. *Stream* – A continuous connection (like a full TCP conversation).

7. *Filter* – Used to narrow down results (e.g., `http`, `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`).

8. *Info Column* – A quick summary of what the packet is doing.

9. *Capture Interface* – The network interface Wireshark uses to listen to traffic.

10. *Time* – Timestamp showing when each packet was captured.

11. *Payload* – The actual data content inside the packet.

12. *Flags* – TCP control bits (like SYN, ACK, FIN) used to manage connections.

13. *Length* – Size of the packet in bytes.

14. *Hex View* – Shows the raw data in hexadecimal form.
